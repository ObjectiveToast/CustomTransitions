 TWTSimpleAnimationController provides a basic implementation of the UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning
 protocol. It allows for customizing transitions between view controllers using UIViewAnimationOptions. This 
 enables easily transitioning between view controllers using flips, page curls, and cross disolves.

 @param duration The duration of the animated transition.
 @param options The animation options used during the transition. This can be used to customize what animation 
     is used.
