# CustomTransitions

This project contains the examples that go along with the Objective Toast article titled [Custom Transitions on iOS](http://objectivetoast.com/2014/03/17/custom-transitions-on-ios/).

## Notes

When you run the app, you will first see a menu with a list of the examples. After you run each example, you can return to the main menu by tapping anywhere in the example view (the one with the colorful background).
